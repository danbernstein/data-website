      <description>This is the first in a series of posts that seek to recreate the methods used in Future ozone-related acute excess mortality under climate and population change scenarios in China: A modeling study. All the posts build on my previous post on forecasting, by using data available from national and international research initatives to project future scenarios for complex systems including atmospheric chemistry, population dynamics, and mortality. This post focuses on the first projection: future change in atmospheric ozone concentrations.</description>

      <description>Introduction I looked into a number of resources to learn how to handle time series data and conduct educated statistical forecasting. Many of these resources jumped right into the equations and lacked a comprehensive introduction and discussion to faciliate learning. I found that a combination of two resources provided the right introduction to the self-learner, such as myself:
Introduction to Time Series Analysis is a website available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Library.</description>
