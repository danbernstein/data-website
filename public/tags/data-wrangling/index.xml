      <description>In climate modeling, predicting future concentrations of various chemicals involves complex dynamic interactions that rely upon expertise in atmospheric chemistry and physics. Dedicated research has developed dynamic models that simulate these future values on various time horizons and provide these datasets for public use. Real-world observational data can be matched to these time series simulations to derive more accurate predictions at particular geographic locations through a process called bias correction. With information that link these chemicals to disease progression, researchers can approximate the future burden of disease.</description>

      <description>My journey in data science This browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: Download PDF  During my junior year of college, I took a class on Literature and Medicine. During the semester, I came across a pop science article about a new concept in medicine that leveraged the placebo effect in drug regimen. I explored the scientific foundations of this new paradigm through my midterm and final paper and argued for additional, ethic trials of Placebo-Controlled Dose Reduction (PCDR) in psoriasis treatment, where there has already been promising results.</description>
