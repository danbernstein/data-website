      <title>Data Viz: Government Shutdown and the 2016 Election</title>

      <description>In January 2019, Axios produced a data visualization to demonstrate how the partial government shutdown was impacting different states and how that related to the outcomes of the 2016 presidential election. The visualization is a little confusing because there are two color scales, one for states that went for Trump and another for Clinton. Because the scales are distinguished by the 2016 winner, but the shade on each scale is determined by the number of federal workers affected by the government shutdown, the visualization is a little confusing.</description>

      <description>I want to improve our scientific and social systems -public health, environment, safety, transportation- to make them more efficient and productive for those in need. I like to create and explore new and creative data sources to generate insights and draw conclusions about the world. During my undergraduate career, I had the opportunity to conduct scientific research at four institutions in three countries and explore technology policy at the Brookings Institution.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, I determined that there was not enough data available to assess the impact of bike lane installation on cyclist incident rates in Washington DC. The methodology I pursued in that post was based on a 2012 article in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) that conducted an analysis of New York City for bike lanes installed between 1996 and 2006, including limiting analysis to the five years before and two years following a bike lane installation to assess impact.</description>

      <title>Computer Vision and Deep Learning to Identify Bikelane Hazards</title>

      <description>At a meeting of the Transportation Techies Meet Up in early 2018, another Techie announced that he had gathered images from traffic cameras around Arlington, VA at intersections with bike lanes. The data is available at here. He suggested that this data would likely be well-suited for computer vision (CV) to automate the process of classifying the images based on whether the bike lane was blocked or not.
I recently decided to learn about computer vision to tackle this challenge.</description>

      <description>This is the fourth and final post in a series that seek to recreate the methods used in Future ozone-related acute excess mortality under climate and population change scenarios in China: A modeling study. All the posts build on my previous post on forecasting, by using data available from national and international research initatives to project future scenarios for complex systems including atmospheric chemistry, population dynamics, and mortality rate. This post focuses on combining the previous three projections to derive human health outcome metrics: attributable fraction and attributable daily death.</description>

      <description>Introduction I looked into a number of resources to learn how to handle time series data and conduct educated statistical forecasting. Many of these resources jumped right into the equations and lacked a comprehensive introduction and discussion to faciliate learning. I found that a combination of two resources provided the right introduction to the self-learner, such as myself:
Introduction to Time Series Analysis is a website available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Library.</description>

      <description>Background John Oliver recently discussed genetic editing on Last Week Tonight. Luckily by chance I have had an automated R script running everyday that collects all tweets that mention the term CRISPR, the leading method of genetic editing at this time. Bringing these two events together, I am interested to see how John Oliver discussing genetic editing might impact the level of social media activity surrounding the topic, represented by the tweets captured mentioned CRISPR.</description>

      <description>The number of bike lanes in DC have proliferated in the past few years, ostensibly providing cyclists with increased safety. However, not all bike lanes are created equal: protected bike lanes with intermittent posts provide greater protection than bike lanes sandwiched between busy streets and parking lanes along the curb. This analysis intends to determine if bike lanes have increased safety, measured in terms of the number of reported crashes involving a cyclist.</description>

      <description>Summary I looked to Kaggle to further practice building predictive models. After optimizing single and ensemble regression techniques, I uncovered ensemble stacking as a method for building a strong predictive model from a collection of weak learners. The outcome is drastic improvements in predictive accuracy. This post will provide an overview of:
the basics of automating data preparation using caret building stacked ensemble modelling using caretEnsemble reason through how the various models that I used improve the ensemble predictions  This post will deal less with the specifics of the dataset, and rather provide an overview of how these packages provide easy, flexible, and powerful methods for developing strong predictive models.</description>

      <description>Motivation This is a quick and dirty regression analysis of the total number of citations that a corpus of documents have received as of the time that the bibliographic data was downloaded.
Data Publication entries on the topic &amp;ldquo;crispr&amp;rdquo; were collected from Web of Science (WOS) on May 26, 2018. Using the topic field query includes both documents that include the search term in the title and abstract. The exported data from WOS is complex, including author information, various IDs, and citation fields, including total citations and a full list of all documents that have referenced the given publication.</description>

      <description>Motivation I have been thinking about networks of science for awhile: collaboration, competition, intellectual property and licensing, etc. At the same time, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats) has emerged as the preeminent gene-editing tool in laboratories across the world (sorry TALENs and all you other fun tools). MIT&amp;rsquo;s Broad Institute and UC Berkeley have been in a protracted legal battle over the patent for the technology underlying new advances in medicine, agriculture, and other consumer industries.</description>

      <description>My journey in data science This browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: Download PDF  During my junior year of college, I took a class on Literature and Medicine. During the semester, I came across a pop science article about a new concept in medicine that leveraged the placebo effect in drug regimen. I explored the scientific foundations of this new paradigm through my midterm and final paper and argued for additional, ethic trials of Placebo-Controlled Dose Reduction (PCDR) in psoriasis treatment, where there has already been promising results.</description>

      <description>The mayor of the District of Columbia released a comprehensive data policy in April 2017, calling for the DC government to maintain and periodically update a publically-available inventory of its enterpise datasets, classify the datasets by level of sensitivity, and strategically plan for investment in data infrastructure. The action established a policy of data being open by default, meaning that any efforts to restrict public access to publically-funded data had to provide an explanation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to explore text mining for awhile. The idea of drawing out core concepts and subtle themes among a corpus of documents adds a quantitative angle to analysis, whether in literature, policy, or science. This project draws on the tidytext library and the great free online book, Text Mining in R to explore some interesting collections of text. This project culminated in a shiny app that covers topic modelling and various text similarity measures.</description>

      <description>Note This is an experimental project that has not been fully implemented. The app runs well locally, so I would recommend going over to my GitHub if you are interested in the source code or the final product. That being said, the webscraping element is in violation of the CaBi website user policy, so I do not endorse the use. I am working on developing an alternative form that allows individuals to upload their ridership data after manually exporting from the website.</description>

      <description>Cycling in Washington, DC is on the rise, and Capital Bikeshare has definitely played a role in getting more people out of their cars and onto their bikes. This project started with the idea to create a map of the most popular cycling routes around the city, and it quickly became a larger endeavor to understand the patterns of Bikeshare usage at each station. This shiny app allows you to choose any station in the network and then visualize up to the top ten most popular routes leaving from or ending at that station.</description>
