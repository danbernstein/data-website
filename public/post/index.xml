      <title>Regression Analysis of Total Citations among CRISPR Publications</title>

      <description>Motivation This is a quick and dirty regression analysis of the total number of citations that a corpus of documents have received as of the time that the bibliographic data was downloaded.
Data Publication entries on the topic &amp;ldquo;crispr&amp;rdquo; were collected from Web of Science (WOS) on May 26, 2018. Using the topic field query includes both documents that include the search term in the title and abstract. The exported data from WOS is complex, including author information, various IDs, and citation fields, including total citations and a full list of all documents that have referenced the given publication.</description>

      <description>Motivation I have been thinking about networks of science for awhile: collaboration, competition, intellectual property and licensing, etc. At the same time, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats) has emerged as the preeminent gene-editing tool in laboratories across the world (sorry TALENs and all you other fun tools). MIT&amp;rsquo;s Broad Institute and UC Berkeley have been in a protracted legal battle over the patent for the technology underlying new advances in medicine, agriculture, and other consumer industries.</description>

      <description>Thank you for your interest in this project. While the paper is written, I am cleaning up the project from data download to analysis for reproducability. I hope to have the final version available here in the coming weeks.

      <description>The mayor of the District of Columbia released a comprehensive data policy in April 2017, calling for the DC government to maintain and periodically update a publically-available inventory of its enterpise datasets, classify the datasets by level of sensitivity, and strategically plan for investment in data infrastructure. The action established a policy of data being open by default, meaning that any efforts to restrict public access to publically-funded data had to provide an explanation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to explore text mining for awhile. The idea of drawing out core concepts and subtle themes among a corpus of documents adds a quantitative angle to analysis, whether in literature, policy, or science. This project draws on the tidytext library and the great free online book, Text Mining in R to explore some interesting collections of text. This project culminated in a shiny app that covers topic modelling and various text similarity measures.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Personal Use</title>

      <description>Note This is an experimental project that has not been fully implemented. The app runs well locally, so I would recommend going over to my GitHub if you are interested in the source code or the final product. That being said, the webscraping element is in violation of the CaBi website user policy, so I do not endorse the use. I am working on developing an alternative form that allows individuals to upload their ridership data after manually exporting from the website.</description>

      <description>Cycling in Washington, DC is on the rise, and Capital Bikeshare has definitely played a role in getting more people out of their cars and onto their bikes. This project started with the idea to create a map of the most popular cycling routes around the city, and it quickly became a larger endeavor to understand the patterns of Bikeshare usage at each station. This shiny app allows you to choose any station in the network and then visualize up to the top ten most popular routes leaving from or ending at that station.</description>
