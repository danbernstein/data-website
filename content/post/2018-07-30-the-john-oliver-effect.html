<h2>Background</h2>
<p>John Oliver recently discussed genetic editing on <em>Last Week Tonight</em>. Luckily by chance I have had an automated R script running everyday that collects all tweets that mention the term <em>CRISPR</em>, the leading method of genetic editing at this time. Bringing these two events together, I am interested to see how John Oliver discussing genetic editing might impact the level of social media activity surrounding the topic, represented by the tweets captured mentioned CRISPR.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Tweets including the term <em>CRISPR</em> were collected using an automated R script (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/twitteR.pdf">twitteR</a> package) between June 9 and July 26, 2018. Unforunately tweets were not collected every day because the computer was not active on every day, though attempts were made to recollect missed days when possible. All collection and analysis was conducted in R 3.4.4.</p>
