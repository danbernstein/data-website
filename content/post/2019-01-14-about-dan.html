<p>I want to improve our scientific and social systems -public health, environment, safety, transportation- to make them more efficient and productive for those in need. I like to create and explore new and creative data sources to generate insights and draw conclusions about the world. During my undergraduate career, I had the opportunity to conduct scientific research at four institutions in three countries and explore technology policy at the Brookings Institution. These experiences have lead me to better understand myself; I am driven by scientific problems and empirical evidence with implications for societal and policy issues.</p>
<p>I hope to spend my career investigating the intersection of analytical methods with health and the environment in the pursuit of technological and policy solutions.</p>
<p>My self-education in data science has included the following readings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R (James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani)</li>
<li>Forecasting: Principles and Practice (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos)</li>
<li>Statistical Analysis of Network Data in R (Kolaczyk and Csardi)</li>
<li>A User’s Guide to Network Analysis in R (Luke)</li>
<li>Advanced R (Wickham)</li>
<li>The R Inferno (Burns)</li>
<li>Programming Computer Vision with Python (Solem)</li>
<li>Deep Learning with Python (Chollet)</li>
<li>Fundamentals of Data Visualization (Wilke)</li>
</ul>
<p>My projects apply these texts’ concepts to interesting questions, often recreating a publication’s methods with new datasets with relevant outcomes.</p>
