I want to improve our scientific and social systems -public health, environment, safety, transportation- to make them more efficient and productive for those in need. I like to create and explore new and creative data sources to generate insights and draw conclusions about the world. 

During my undergraduate career, I had the opportunity to conduct scientific research at four institutions in three countries and explore technology policy at the Brookings Institution. These experiences have lead me to better understand myself; I am driven by scientific problems and empirical evidence with implications for societal and policy issues.

I hope to spend my career investigating the intersection of analytical methods with health and the environment in the pursuit of technological and policy solutions.

My self-education in data science has included the following readings: 

* Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R (James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani)
* Forecasting: Principles and Practice (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos)
* Statistical Analysis of Network Data in R (Kolaczyk and Csardi)
* A User's Guide to Network Analysis in R (Luke)
* Advanced R (Wickham)
* The R Inferno (Burns)
* Programming Computer Vision with Python (Solem)
* Deep Learning with Python (Chollet)

My projects apply these texts' concepts to interesting questions, often recreating a publication's methods with new datasets with relevant outcomes.
